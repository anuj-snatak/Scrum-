## Introduction

A **monorepo (monolithic repository)** is a version-controlled code repository that holds multiple projectsâ€”often from the same organization. Instead of maintaining many small repositories, all code is stored in a **single, central repository**, enabling unified management, visibility, and collaboration.

---

## Why Monorepo?

Organizations adopt monorepo to:

* Simplify **dependency management** across services.
* Allow **atomic commits** across multiple projects.
* Improve **tooling consistency** and CI/CD integration.
* Facilitate **easier cross-team collaboration**.

It works especially well for microservices, component libraries, design systems, and platform-driven development.

## Features of Monorepo

| Feature                          | Description                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unified Source of Truth          | All code resides in one place.                                            |
| Shared Build & CI Infrastructure | Centralized build pipelines using tools like Nx, Bazel, Turborepo, etc.   |
| Code Sharing                     | Easy reuse of components and utilities.                                   |
| Global Refactoring               | Change multiple services/libraries in one commit.                         |
| Access Control                   | Role-based access possible on folders using tools like GitHub CODEOWNERS. |

---

## Advantages

* **Atomic changes** across multiple packages/projects.
* **Simplified versioning** when using tools like Lerna/Nx.
* **Easy dependency updates** and shared tooling.
* **Centralized governance** and easier code reviews.
* **Better discoverability** of internal packages.

## 5. Challenges / Disadvantages

| Challenge            | Details                                                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Performance          | CI/CD pipelines may become slow without proper caching & task runners. |
| Scalability          | Very large codebases need optimized tooling (e.g., Bazel, Nx).         |
| Access Control       | More complex if granular permissions are needed across teams.          |
| Code Conflicts       | More developers = higher chances of merge conflicts.                   |
| Tooling Requirements | Needs advanced setup: affected builds, lint scoping, CI optimization.  |

##  Monorepo Workflow

### Step-by-step Dev + CI/CD Flow:

1. **Code is organized** as separate packages under `packages/` or `apps/` directory.
2. Developers work on **isolated branches** using affected scopes.
3. **Code reviewers** validate changes using `CODEOWNERS` or module leads.
4. **Linting/Testing/Build**: Performed **per package**, using tools like:

   * `Nx` (affected builds)
   * `Turborepo`
   * `Lerna` (if using versioning)
5. **Merge to main** triggers full/partial CI builds.
6. Deployment is handled by **CI pipelines**, scoped to affected apps.

---

## Best Practices

*  **Use Affected Scopes**: Only build/test what changed using Nx or Bazel.
*  **Modularize**: Structure code into apps/libs with clear ownership.
*  **Automated Codeowners**: Use CODEOWNERS for PR assignment.
*  **Standardize Tooling**: Lint, format, and test rules across all projects.
*  **Optimize CI**: Use distributed caching and parallelism.
*  **Isolate Dependencies**: Keep packages decoupled with clear contracts.
*  **Govern Access**: Enforce permissions via GitHub or GitLab features.

---

## Conclusion (Strategy to Follow)

**Strategy Chosen**:
We will **adopt a Monorepo strategy** using **Nx** as the primary monorepo tool for managing multiple front-end/back-end applications. Nx supports **incremental builds**, **project boundaries**, and advanced dependency graphing.

### Why this strategy?

* Enables **faster CI/CD** with affected builds.
* Scales well with **multiple teams** and microservices.
* Provides **first-class TypeScript/JavaScript support**.
* Supports **custom executors**, caching, and enhanced DX (developer experience).
